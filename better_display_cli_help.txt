## General overview and syntax

The app supports the following integration methods:

- Command line integration
- Custom URL scheme based integration
- HTTP integration
- Notification based integration - for more details on this, see: https://betterdisplay.pro/integration
- macOS Shortcuts (App Intents)

The various integration methods can be separately enabled and disabled under Settings in the application UI.

An integration command might receive one or more operations and zero or more parameters. A parameter might or might not have a value associated with it.

### Syntax for command line access:

`./BetterDisplay operation [operation] [-parameter[=value]] [-parameter[=value]]`

Notes:

- The app binary `BetterDisplay` is available in the installed macOS app bundle (the full path when installed under `Applications` is `/Applications/BetterDisplay.app/Contents/MacOS/BetterDisplay`).
- You can use both single and double hyphen parameter style.

You can also use `betterdisplaycli` for simpler access. Installation via Homebrew:

`brew install waydabber/betterdisplay/betterdisplaycli`

Examples (both commands set the brightness of a display with the name `MyDisplay` to 80%):

`./BetterDisplay set -name=MyDisplay -brightness=0.8`

`betterdisplaycli set --name=MyDisplay --brightness=80%`

### Syntax for custom URL scheme integration:

`BetterDisplay://operation/[operation/ (â€¦)][?parameter[=value]][&parameter[=value]]`

Example (raw URL and scripted access using `open` command with proper escaping):

`BetterDisplay://set?name=MyDisplay&brightness=0.8`

`open BetterDisplay://set\?name=MyDisplay\&brightness=0.8`

To safeguard access, a special token can optionally be defined in Settings which must then be present in the URL via a `token=` parameter. The custom URL scheme integration supports x-callback-url to report back success or error and results. More information: https://x-callback-url.com/specification/

### Syntax for HTTP based integration:

`http://<hostname>:55777/command/[command/][?parameter[=value]][&parameter[=value]]`

Example (raw URL and scripted access using `curl` command with proper escaping):

`http://localhost:55777/set?name=MyDisplay&brightness=0.8`

`curl http://localhost:55777/set\?name=MyDisplay\&brightness=0.8`

The listening port can be customized under Settings. Example uses local access via `localhost` - use the appropriate hostname with remote calls. To safeguard access, a special token can optionally be defined in Settings which must then be present in the URL via a `token=` parameter.

With URLs you can use `%20` to substitute for space.

## Operations

Operations define how a command will be interpreted. Some operations can be combined (for example `set` or `toggle` with `get` to both set and get a value.

- `perform` - Perform a command. Used for features that do not expect any value.
- `set` - Sets a value. Can be used for features that excpect a value to set.
- `get` - Gets a value. Useful for features that can report some kind of value (and optionally minimum and maximum values for features where a range makes sense).
- `toggle` - Toggle a bool value. Can be used for on/off (togglable) features.
- `feed` - Updates the value of a custom control without performing a set operation. Can be used to feed/synchronize data to the custom control from an external source.
- `create` - Create a device. You need to specify `deviceType=VirtualScreen`. You can add other `set` operation parameters to configure the virtual screen or alter its identifiers from default. If an identifier is not provided, the app will provide a default or (if it makes sense) random value.
- `discard` - Discard a device. Use various device identifiers using identification parameters to narrow the devices you want to discard. Warning: without identifiers, the app will discard all discardable devices without question and any ability to undo - be careful with this!
- `help` - Provides help about general usage or a specified operation, feature or parameter.

## Parameters

Parameters affect how an operation is carried out. Some parameters can be mixed with each other. Parameters may or may not have values. Some parameters require additional parameters to function.

### Device identification and device listing

- `tagID` - Identify a device via the display's tagID which is a BetterDisplay provided unique numeric ID specific to this app installation.
- `UUID` - Identify a device via the display's UUID assigned by this macOS installation.
- `displayID` - Identify a device using the displayID issued by macOS. This ID might change from time-to-time.
- `name` - Identify a device using its displayed name in BetterDisplay.
- `nameLike` (or `n`) - Identify a device using a part of its displayed name in BetterDisplay (case insensitive).
- `originalName` - Identify a device using its name in BetterDisplay.
- `originalNameLike` - Identify a device using a part of its name in BetterDisplay (case insensitive).
- `productName` - Identify a device using its product name (as recorded in the display EDID).
- `productNameLike` - Identify a device using a part of its name (as recorded in the display EDID, case insensitive).
- `vendor` - Identify a device using its vendor code (numeric value).
- `model` - Identify a device using its model number.
- `serial` - Identify a device using its serial number.
- `alphanumericSerial` - Identify a device using its alphanumerical serial identifier.
- `yearOfManufacture` - Identify a device using the year of manufacture.
- `weekOfManufacture` - Identify a device using the week of manufacture.
- `registryLocation` - Identify a device using its I/O registry location string.
- `deviceType` - Identify a device based on its type. Can be `Display` or `VirtualScreen`.
- `displayWithMouse` - Identify the display with mouse.
- `displayWithFocus` - Identify the display with the focused window.
- `displayWithMainStatus` - Identify the display set as main.
- `displayWithNonMainStatus` - Identify display(s) set as non-main.

### Setting or getting values

- `value` - Provides value when required for a feature or operation. Depending on the feature, the value may be an integer number, real number, percentage, `on` or `off` (for togglable features) or string. For most parameters you can use a more direct `-<feature_name>=[value]` syntax instead). When used with the `get` operation, provide this if you explicitly want the current value returned alongside minimum `min` or maximum `max` values.
- `offset` - Signifies that any of the specified values are offset values (positive or negative) for features where it makes sense (these usually expect some real number or percentage as value). For example, providing `-10%` as value for a parameter will decrease the value of a feature (let's say `brightness`) by 10%.
- `min` - If added without a value, the `get` operation will return the minimum value if it makes sense for the accessed feature. If added with a value for a set or get operation, it acts as a normalizaton tool to specify the lower bound of the value range on which the provided value must be interpreted or the requested value to be returned.
- `max` - If added without a value, the `get` operation will return the maximum value if it makes sense for the accessed feature. If added with a value for a set or get operation, it acts as a normalizaton tool to specify the upper bound of the value range on which the provided value must be interpreted or the requested value to be returned.
